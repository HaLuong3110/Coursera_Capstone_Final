#INTRODUCTION Business Problem
The problem statement is to predict severity of road accidents caused by a wide variety of factors in Seattle City. It will be very useful an accurate prediction to the following audience:
City administration
Seattle city administrators can take precautions based on this data. They can set up speed limits and other precautionary measures such as speed breakers.
Hospitals
Hospitals can be placed near high accident areas in order to help quickly to any victim.
All of us
Due to the weather, road conditions or locations we can be aware about dangers an drive carefully or even change our route towards our destiny.

#DATA
The data I will use in this project is accident severity data in Seattle.
